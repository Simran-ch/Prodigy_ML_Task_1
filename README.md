# Prodigy_ML_Task_1
Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.


## Task 1: Linear Regression for House Price Prediction

**Dataset:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/housing-prices-dataset
<br>

This task is part of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech, where I implemented a machine learning model to predict house prices based on given features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. The task demonstrates the use of Linear Regression for predictive modeling.
<br>

**--Project Overview--**
<br>

The goal of this task is to build a regression model that accurately predicts house prices using a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes features such as:
<br>
:) Square Footage
<br>
:) Number of Bedrooms
<br>
:) Number of Bathrooms
<br>
:) stories (Number of House Stories)
<br>
:) mainroad (Whether connected to Main Road)
<br>
:) guestroom (Whether has a guest room)
<br>
:) basement (Whether has a basement)
<br>
:) hotwaterheating (Whether has a hotwater heater)
<br>
:) airconditioning (Whether has an airconditioning)
<br>

By training a linear regression model, we can identify the relationship between these features and house prices.
<br>

**--Tools Used--**
<br>

**Python** : For scripting and implementation.
<br>
**Google Colab** : For writing and running the code in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
<br>

**--Libraries Used--**
<br>

**numpy**: For numerical computations.
<br>
**pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
<br>
**scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating the linear regression model.
<br>

**--Implementation Steps--**
<br>

(1) **Data Preprocessing**: 
<br>
:) Handled missing values, if any.
<br>
:) Performed data exploration and visualization to understand the relationships between features and target values.
<br>

(2) **Feature Engineering**:
<br>
:) Selected relevant features for the prediction model.
<br>

(3) **Model Building**:
<br>
:) Implemented a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.
<br>

(4) **Evaluation**:
<br>
:) Used metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R² Score to evaluate model performance.
<br>

**--Results--**
<br>

The model successfully captured the relationship between house features and prices.
<br>

**--Evaluation Metrics--**
<br>

**R² Score**: [0.4559299118872445]
<br>
**Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: [1658324.6001036866]
